1.0.0 release

This release introduces two new features:

- Collections, which allow PODs to be stored in separate buckets with different access levels for different Zapps
- Permissions, which allow your Zapp to specify which features it requires access to

For documentation on these features, visit https://zappsdk.netlify.app or see the example code at `examples/test-app`.
